                <h3>Scenario</h3>
                <p>You are setting up as an independent consultant, which is very
                exciting, however, you’re going to need a website of your own
                to highlight your skills, availability and areas of work. It’s time
                for you to create a website that details you, and including
                pages/sections and a how you built it page</p>
                <h2><br></h2>
                
                <h3>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h3>
                <p><b>Home Page</b> - On this page, It will display my logo on the top left and my nav right on the top right of the website.<br>
                Underneath that, there is a showcase where i added a image of all the cartoon and games that i am into.<br>
                Below that, I have written an about me section.<br>
                <b>Unit 1 Outcome 1-3</b> - On these 3 pages, it will show my answers for all the questions in this project.<br>
                <b>Unit 2 Outcome 1</b> - This will show you the answes for Unit 2 - Outcome 1
                </p>
                <h2><br></h2>
                
                <h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>
                <p>Copyrights allows someone to creates an website and owns the rights to the image. Only the owner of the image has the rights to reproduce the work, display, copy and sell to other people<br>
                Many websites offers pictures or templates that are free or you can get permission from the original author to let them allow you to use the images or templates for your website.<br>
                If you want to publish information on your website from another site, you will be able to link to it or asked permission to publish it on your site.                
                </p>
                <h2><br></h2>
                
                <h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h3>
                <p>
                A issue that i may need to take into account is the showcase image i have displayed on my website, due to the bright colours and funky cartoon images. <br>
                This may affect users with disabilities.<br>
                A way to overcome this is to allow users to have a option to select a darker or light mode, which changes the whole theme of the website which would allow users to experience a different theme.<br>
                </p>
                <h2><br></h2>
                
                <h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>
                <p>
                There are many filetypes for website such as, .CSS, .HTML,.GIF, .PNG, .JPEG, .PDF.<br>
                The most appropriate filetypes for websites are images filetype which are, .PNG, .JPEG, .GIF.<br>
                Without images, our website would only be texted based. So i believe that they are appropriate filetype for websites.
