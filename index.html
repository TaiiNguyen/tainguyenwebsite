                <img src="images/tainguyen.jpg" border="3" style="float: left; margin: 15px;">
                <p><br>My name is Tai Nguyen and i am from a IT background. Before this course, i was working for an MSP for 3 years dealing with IT infrastructor and IT Support. 
                <br>The reason why i joined this course is because, i have always wanted to do coding and never had the opportunity to do so. 
                <br>At a young age, i was playing computers games and building websites using HTML and never knew how website designers was able to add CSS to their website. 
                <br>This course has given me the the opportunity to learn HTML and CSS which has allowed me to implentment it to my website.
                <br>I also learnt Python and this was a great experience for me and i really enjoyed it, learning a new code always excites me and making it work is what i thrive for.
                <br>I would love to be able to use the skills ive gain and be able to become a full stack developer in the near future.
