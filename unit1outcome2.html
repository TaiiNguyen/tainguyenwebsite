                <h3>Scenario</h3>
                <p>Now you have setup your blog, it’s time to get into the detail.
                    You now need to critically review your website.</p>
                <h2><br></h2>
                
                <h3>2.1 - Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?</h3>
                <p>The tools that i was introduced in my course was Visual Studio Code and Trello, Both with which i have never experienced.<br>
                Visual Studio Code is good at allowing and customisation and extensibilty which was very easy to use.<br>
                But the main positive is that i was able to code in different language such as Python, HTML, CSS and etc..<br>
                A IT Tool that i used for my project was Trello, Trello allow me to priotise and manage my project, from being able to set myself tasks and making sure i finish the work on the right timescale. <br>
                Using these tools mention has made my project run smoothly, which is great for a first time coder!</p>
                <h2><br></h2>
                
                <h3>2.2 - Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h3>
                <p>The IT tools selected was suitable because they were both easy to use and with the internet nowadays, we are able to find guides and how-to.<br>
                Being able to use Visual Code Studio allowed me to write in many different coding languages, so i was able to flick through a HTML and CSS file without changing the software.<br>
                Trello was very suitable for my project because i was able to keep on track of to-do lists, share files, comment on tasks and being able to use it on my phone as it was mobile friendly.
                </p>
                <h2><br></h2>
                
                <h3>2.3 - Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h3>
                <p>I am very happy with my website and the way it planned out. I always have a picture of what i want and after many attemps and research, I am proud to say that i am happy with my work<br>
                I know that this is just the beginning and that there are many more things you can do but that is what i thrive for and would love to learn more!<br>
                There are always room for improvements but nevertheless i am happy that i was able to create my first website and being able to understand what i was coding.<br>
                One weakness from this project is that i wasted a lot of time deciding what template and theme i would like to have as my first website.                
                </p>
                <h2><br></h2>
                
                <h3>2.4 - Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>
                <p>I would love to be able to add my Python game that i did on the group onto my website, which was playable. I believe that is possible but i may need to do more research about it.<br>
                I would also want to add more graphics to my website, so that it looks good in the eye!<br>
                Improving the content and adding a contact page would also improve my website, but i decided to have my socials on the right of the window.
                </p>
                <h2><br></h2>
                
                <h3>2.5 - Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>
                <p>Reviewing the outcomes i believe that my website matches the requirements and fits the purpose for this project.<br>
                Being able to make a website using HTML and CSS and displaying content on the website correctly.
