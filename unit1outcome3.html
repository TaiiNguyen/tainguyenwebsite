                <h3>Scenario</h3>
                <p>Now you have setup your blog, itâ€™s time to get into the detail.
                    You now need to critically review your website.</p>
                <h2><br></h2>
                
                <h3>3.1 - Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h3>
                <p>
                A drawback on my IT system is that i did not have a second screen to be able to multitask in both screen.<br>
                Being able to multitask would allow me to work more efficiency.<br>
                Another drawback is that my laptop was not powerful enough and my system was slow when running many projects at one time.<br>
                The benefits that i had was having a bit of experience with HTML at a young age, I used to create website only using HTML but once i learnt how to integrate CSS to HTML.<br>
                It made my life much easier and that i was able to CSS to define styles for my web pages.
                </p>

                <h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
                <p>
                A way to improve productivity and efficiency is by communicating and making sure that you used a Trello board to keep up to date with tasks.<br>
                Trello is a great way to project a board so that you can see all the items on one page, creating tasks and issues and assigning someone to those task are simple and easy.<br>
                Another way to improve productivity and efficiency is making sure you have the right equipment and tech so that you can complete your task without any issues which will cause delay.                         
                </p>
                <h2><br></h2>
                
                <h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h3>
                <p>
                A way i would improve productivity using IT in digital projects is working in a team and being able to use tools such as Trello to set and track task and bringing the projects i am working on under one tool.<br>
                It would also be great if we was in a office or classroom and was able to communicate face to face and not using Zoom calls, this would improve productivity massively!<br>
                Another solution that would improve productivity when using IT in digital projects is having the right tools and equipment such as, having a powerful computer, multi screen for multitasking and paid softwares to make sure you have every tool needed to complete your task.<br>
                But with the resources i have now, i am very happy with what i have achieved.

                <h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
                <p>
                First thing i would test is making sure my website can be displayed in different browser across different devices used by users.<br>
